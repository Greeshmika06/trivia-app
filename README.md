## Why I chose it
This is my first web development project, and I wanted to build something simple and fun. A Trivia game was the perfect choice because it allowed me to use the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main goal was to learn how to structure a webpage, handle user input, and use JavaScript to make things dynamic.
